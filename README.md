I'm working on [*Human Computer
Simulator*](https://github.com/DanielZTing/human-computer-simulator), an
educational game about data structures and algorithms in computer
science. I also contribute (or try, at least) to [TAMS
CSO](https://github.com/tams-cso) and [Godot
Engine](https://github.com/godotengine).

I don't know what else to put here, so here's some turtles.
